# **Retail Sales Analysis: End-to-End Python + SQL + Excel Project**

## ** Project Overview**
This project is an **end-to-end data analysis solution** designed to extract critical business insights from **retail sales data** using **Python, SQL, and Excel**. The project focuses on data processing, querying, visualization, and structured problem-solving to analyze **sales trends, branch-wise performance, customer preferences, and profitability metrics**.

 **Key Objectives:**
- Analyze **sales performance** across time, branches, and categories.
- Identify **customer buying patterns** based on time of day and payment methods.
- **Optimize profitability** by tracking top-selling products and revenue trends.
- Present findings through **interactive dashboards** and visualizations.

## ** Project Pipeline**
### **1Ô∏è. Set Up the Environment**
- **Tools Used:** Python, MySQL, Excel, Jupyter Notebook
- **Goal:** Create a structured workspace and install necessary dependencies.

### **2Ô∏è. Data Collection**
- **Source:** Kaggle or custom sales dataset
- **Storage:** Store datasets in the `data/` folder for easy access.

### **3Ô∏è. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
- Remove **duplicates** and handle **missing values**.
- Convert **data types** (dates, currency values, etc.).
- Standardize **column names** for consistency.

### **4Ô∏è. Feature Engineering**
- **Calculate Total Sales** (`unit_price * quantity`).
- Create **time-based features** (e.g., sales per day, peak hours).

### **5Ô∏è. Load Data into SQL Database**
- Connect to **MySQL/PostgreSQL** using `sqlalchemy`.
- Automate table creation and **insert cleaned data**.
- Verify data accuracy through SQL queries.

### **6Ô∏è. SQL Analysis & Business Insights**
- **Revenue & Profitability Trends** by category and branch.
- **Peak Sales Periods** based on time of day.
- **Customer Payment Preferences** (Cash, Credit Card, E-Wallet).
- **Branch-wise Performance** and sales distribution.

### **7Ô∏è. Visualization & Reporting**
- **Excel Dashboard:** Interactive pivot tables and charts.

### **8Ô∏è. Project Documentation & Deployment**
- **Markdown documentation (`README.md`)** for GitHub.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for Python analysis.
- **SQL query scripts** for business insights.

## ** Tech Stack Used**
 **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy  
 **SQL:** MySQL/PostgreSQL for data querying and storage  
 **Excel:** Pivot tables, charts, and dashboards for visualization  
 **Jupyter Notebook:** Development environment  

---
## ** Results & Insights**
 **Sales Trends:** Identified peak sales months and high-revenue categories.  
 **Branch Performance:** Ranked stores based on revenue contribution.  
 **Customer Preferences:** Cash is the most used payment method, but e-wallet adoption is rising.  
 **Profit Margins:** Found underperforming categories and suggested improvement strategies.
